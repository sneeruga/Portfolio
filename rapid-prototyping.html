          <p class="flow-text">In this fitness app, users can set a goal based on steps or calories. You can create the goal using your mobile phone and facilitate that goal using the smartwatch. When creating a goal on your mobile phone you can set how many steps you want to complete and by what time you would like to complete the goal. For every goal you complete, you will receive money as an incentive to keep up with your fitness/health goals. You can edit your goals using your mobile phone and smartwatch. On the smartwatch you can view your progress as you continue to complete your goals. The paper prototypes were created to test the functionality of the mobile app and smartwatch. The test is created to test how to create a fitness goal using the mobile app and how to monitor and edit goals using the smartwatch.

          <p class="flow-text">Question everything and test with many different kinds of users. That is the lesson I learned when designing shower interface prototypes. It is important to apply the universal design principle and account the many people who would use the product. Before I designined the 3 shower interfaces, I conducted a competitive analysis to learn what kinds of products are in the market. Mapping out the different products in the market made it apparent that there was no shower interface that tackled the problem of water conservation. The supply of water is not limitless and by saving water in the shower here and there can make a difference. The shower interfaces account for water conversation techniques as well as the steam within the shower or the fact that your eyes might be closed due to shampoo/conditioner or water.

          <p class="flow-text">The video prototype is used to demonstrate clearly and effectively (and creatively) the functionality of a product, in this case for mobile site University of Washington Canvas Maps. This video can be thought of as a concise product pitch that might be used in seeking an investor for your design, which does not yet exist in more than concept or rough mockup. This is a product demo and not a test.
The challenge is to create a video that comprehensively and concisely communicates the motivation, usage, and functionality of the Canvas Maps mobile site. This video was ideated, created, and edited in 1 hour!

          <p class="flow-text">We wanted to test a hands-free video playback system that people could use while holding items in their hands (ex. food). Instead of giving participants head gestures we made up, we were curious to see what they would come up with themselves and what would be intuitive. We decided to create a “calibration software technology” that we would put in front of users so they could create their own head gestures that would be used to control the video playback. The wizard calibration software was created using PowerPoint slides and animations. We used Netflix for video playback and controlled the video using TeamViewer, a remote control smartphone app that allows you to control a laptop screen. The person who acted as the Wizard sat to the side and as the participants made their head gestures, the Wizard would use the controls on the smartphone app to control the Netflix video discreetly.
